## Project Report 

## Reflection
For the first iteration of this project, I had some set backs. I had this really cool image in my head of the game I wanted to make where it was in 3-D, had tons of interactibilty, and it look really amazing. I started with this in mind and ended up stoping and starting over with a much more simplictic design. This is because 3-D made programing a bit to complicated along with find good materials and assests for a 3d World. Moving forward, my project is looking a lot better, and I am excited to move onto the next iteration.
